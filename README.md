# Escape Room: Prison Break at Fox River

Welcome to **Prison Break: Fox River**, an immersive escape room experience where you find yourself trapped in the cold, dimly lit cell of Fox River State Penitentiary. Framed for a crime you didn't commit, your mission is clear: escape before it's too late. The walls around you hold secrets, and you’ve been meticulously planning for months, waiting for the perfect moment to make your move. That moment is now.

As the seconds tick by, every decision matters. Explore your surroundings carefully, solve intricate puzzles, and outsmart the guards who make regular rounds. The tools for your escape are hidden in plain sight, but you’ll need to be quick and clever to find them before time runs out. The stakes couldn’t be higher—failure means a life behind bars.

This is a test of wits, speed, and determination. Can you break out of Fox River, clear your name, and reclaim your freedom? The countdown has started.
